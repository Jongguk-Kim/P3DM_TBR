P3DM Version History

2021.06.16
1. Modified the logic for Constant ga. kerf (TBR AH33)
2. Modified the logic for collecting the nodes on side surface to contact them to upper side profile (TBR DL11)
3. the nodes (for TBR within target TDW) on bottom elements in pattern move to make them bricks
   - Nodes on bottom surface in TBR pattern mesh move far to the belt topping almost 3~4mm, that sometiemes makes elements distorted. 
4. Improved the element shape stability by moving the nodes to the same lateral distance compared with the initial configuration (TBR AL20W)
   - it's useful when its groove depth is increase. 
5. Improve the logic for the tread bottom elements in TBR

2021.06.03 
1. Improving the algorithm to search the solid element on the center top memebrane element 
   - It starts from this element to search the elements to replace with pattern mesh.
2. Generating TBR Chafer elset to left and right 

2021.06.02
1. It needs to measure the pattern gauge at shoulder less than the element should be too small. 
   but when the lateral length of the element is small, P3DM recognize it as a gauge. 
   It is fixed. 
2. When there are 3-node elements during searching the crown elements to remove, 
   sometiemes the searching direction is backwards. 
   the searching algorithm is modified. 
3. Fixing the algorithm to search upper elements 
   - if the element direction is turned or not 
4. Modifying the target pattern Width after removing crown area 
   - less than the height of the nodes at pattern side are reversed. 
5. During removing crown elements in layout, searching the removing elemens stops. 

2021.05.03
1. deco expansion ratio adjusting to that of the TDW_profile/TDW_ptn when the lenght of the last curve is short

2021.05.24 
1. SMART Input file generation : Modifying Belt/Reinforcement Belt Radius calculation logic 
   - The same with the ISLM calculatoin logic 
2. Fixing the equivalent density of rebar elements (P3DM had showed the density from PLM)

2021.05.21
1. TIE의 Slave surface개수가 4개까지만 찾던 것을 갯수 제한 없이 찾도록 변경 

2021.05.18 
1. Groove Tire model: YTIE1001 Surface를 Tread 요소 전체 외곽 Surface에서 Body와의 접합면으로 한정 

2021.05.17
0. SMART 해석 시 XTRD1001의 Surface에서 복사 효과 반영됨 --> XTRD1001의 Surface가 Tread 요소의 전체에 대해 설정되어 있어
   해석 시 온도 낮아지고, 이에 따라 사용되는 물성의 Modulus와 Tan d 값이 높아 해석 값의 오류 발생 
1. Groove Tire Model: XTRD1001의 Surface를 Tread 요소 전체 외곽 Surface에서 Tire 외곽 부분만으로 한정 
2. Pattern Tire Model : XTRD1001의 Surface에서 Pattern Mesh 바닥 요소 삭제함 

2021.5.12 
1. Auto simulation time input 
2. Add Save-as function 

2021.04.23 
1. Remove the pattern side surface from top surface (PCR)
2. Update the logic to search the removing tread elements in TBR (there was no 3-node element in sub tread)
3. 3D model generation without Cap/Sub Tread

2021.03.31 
1. Generation of the 2-pitch model pattern 
2. Fixing TBR NCF material properties in viewer 

2021.02.25
1. Carcass Radius calculation logic modification 
2. FricView input file generation for a Groove Tire 
3. Improved Tread elimination logic 
4. Fixing error when there is/are hole(S) in the bottom surface

2021.01.31
1. SMART Simulation Stability improved.  
  - sometimes top nodes on pattern side surface (PCR) do not attatch to the body (TIE option)
2. Option to generate Sub Tread Elset 
3. SMART Input generator added 
4. Groove tire model generation 

2020.12.29 
1. Logic to keep Kerf Gauge constant updated.
